# Decision Tree Classifier

## Overview
This project implements a **Decision Tree Classifier** using Python. The notebook covers data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Features
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection
- Training a Decision Tree model
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Decision Tree visualization

## Requirements
To run this project, install the following dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage
1. **Open Jupyter Notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "decision tree .ipynb"
   ```
2. **Run each cell sequentially** to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
3. **Modify hyperparameters** if needed to improve the model.

## Results
The trained Decision Tree model predicts the target variable based on input features and is evaluated using various metrics.
